# Query 2

Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets, "employee_data" and "open_positions".

Here is a sample of 6 rows from employee_data, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
employee_id	available_date	work_skill	region
1067	8/29/2024	A	1
1134	7/2/2024	A	1
1201	6/3/2024	B	1
1268	10/5/2024	A	1
1335	7/20/2024	B	2
1402	8/29/2024	A	1

Here is a sample of 6 rows from open_positions, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
position_ID	start_date	work_skill	region
1016	11/23/2024	B	1
1037	12/21/2024	A	1
1033	8/25/2024	A	1
1013	3/25/2025	A	1
1032	1/2/2025	A	2

Here is what I am trying to do:
I need to match/pair every row from employee_data to a row from open_positions.  Each employee_data row can only be paired once and each open_positions row can only be matched once. For each match, the available_date must be before the start_date.

Given above, loop through all potential sets of matches. For each loop, do the following:
	For each row pairing, calculate "points", which is defined this way:
		The days between the available_date and start_date count as one point. However, if the days between available_date and start_date are greater than 30, then add 500 points and do not calculate the difference in days.
		If the work_skill is different, then add 500 points.
		If the region is different, then add 250 points.
	Total the points from all the row pairings.
	For each row that is not able to be matched, add 1000 points to the total.
	If the loop is the first loop then save the total points score of the loop in a variable called lowest_total_points. 
	If it is not the first loop, check to see if this loop's total points is less than lowest_total_points value. If this loop's total points is less than lowest_total_points then save the employee_id/position_ID matches from this loop into a data frame. And assign the current lowest points value to lowest_total_points.
After all the cycles are over, the saved data frame should be the one with the lowest total points. Does this make sense? Is it something you can do?



# test query - not correct approach
Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets:

employee_id	available_date	points
21	5/7/2024	0
1	8/29/2024	999
76	8/29/2024	499

Open position data set sample rows:
position_ID	start_date
1	8/4/2024
2	1/6/2025
3	3/17/2025
