# Realy query 4, assuming we already have matched scores

Please help me write an R script. I have a data set below:


employee_id	position_id	points
1067	1016	100
1134	1016	500
1201	1016	500
1268	1016	500
1067	1037	1000
1134	1037	100
1201	1037	250
1268	1037	750
1067	1033	1000
1134	1033	250
1201	1033	0
1268	1033	0
1067	1013	100
1134	1013	250
1201	1013	400
1268	1013	100

There are three columns:
employee_id - this is the id number of each employee_data
position_id - this is the id number of each position that needs an opening
points - this is the number of points that it costs to have the employee_id in this position_ID

There are 4 employee_idss and 4 position_ids. We need to align each employee_id to a single position_id and each position_ids can be assigned to only one employee_id.  That means there are 4! different possible combinations of employee_id/position_id matches. 

Can you write an algorithm that will cycle through all 4! different combinations and identify the combination with the lowest score?


# Query 4

Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets, "employee_data" and "open_positions".

Here is the employee_data data set:
employee_id	available_date	work_skill	region
1067	8/29/2024	A	1
1134	7/2/2024	A	1
1201	6/3/2024	B	1

1402	8/29/2024	A	1
1469	6/12/2024	A	2
1536	6/11/2024	A	2
1603	5/6/2024	A	2
1670	9/21/2024	A	2
1737	9/21/2024	A	2
1804	7/10/2024	B	1
1871	9/20/2024	A	2

2139	6/20/2024	A	1
2206	6/30/2024	A	2
2273	8/29/2024	B	2


Here is the open_positions data set:
position_ID	start_date	work_skill	region
1016	11/23/2024	B	1
1037	12/21/2024	A	1
1033	8/25/2024	A	1
1013	3/25/2025	A	1
1032	1/2/2025	A	1
1028	8/23/2024	B	1
1065	4/1/2025	B	1
1021	11/29/2024	B	1
1020	10/24/2024	A	1
1097	6/5/2024	B	1
1076	3/12/2025	A	1
1001	1/17/2025	A	1
1042	11/15/2024	B	1
1085	3/16/2025	B	1
1060	1/2/2025	B	1
1095	10/8/2024	B	1
1067	5/19/2024	A	1
1061	2/3/2025	A	1
1011	3/5/2025	A	1


I need to try to match/pair rows from employee_data to a row from open_positions as efficiently as possible. Sometimes I may not be able to find a match.  Each employee_data row can only be paired once and each open_positions row can only be matched once. 

First, create the data sets above.

Next, create a function called calculate_points that will be used later. It calculates "points", which is defined this way:
		The days between the available_date and start_date count as one point. However, if the days between available_date and start_date are greater than 30, then add 500 points and do not calculate the difference in days.
		If the work_skill is different, then add 500 points.
		If the region is different, then add 250 points.
		If the available_date is after the start_date then add 1000 points.

Then calculate the score for each employee_id at each position_ID.  There should be about 361 different combinations.

Next we will want to iterate through all possible combinations of the 18 employee_ids and position_IDs and add all the scores of the 18 employee_id/position_ID matches and figure out the lowest possbile score. There will be 18! different scores and we want to find the combination of matches that has the lowest score. Keep in mind that for every iteration, each employee_id can be used only once and each position_ID can be used only once.

It might save computation to somehow keep track of the combination that is the lowest score as you go along, maybe in an object called best_combination. So, for example, on iteration 1, it will save the combination as best_combination because it is the first run. The 2nd iteration will compare its score to the best_combination from iteration 1 and if it is lower, then it will replace the iteration 1 combination with the iteration 2 combination. If the score is higher, it will leave the iteration 1 combination. And so on.

Does this make sense? Is it something you can do?

		If the available_date is after the start_date then add 1000 points.

Now, create a variable called lowest_points and assign it a value of 100000000.
Now, create an empty data frame called best_matches.

Now, loop through every possible permutation of matches between our two data sets "employee_data" and "open_positions". Remember during in each loop, each employee_data row and each open_positions row can only be used once.  
In each loop, use calculate_points to calculate the points for each row pairing. Add all the points from the matches into a variable called "total_loop_points".  If total_loop_points is less than lowest_points value then update lowest_points to be the value of total_loop_points and save the employee_id and position_ID matches into best_matches.

After all the cycles are over, the saved data frame should be the one with the lowest total points. Does this make sense? Is it something you can do?






# Query 2

Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets, "employee_data" and "open_positions".

Here is a sample of 6 rows from employee_data, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
employee_id	available_date	work_skill	region
1067	8/29/2024	A	1
1134	7/2/2024	A	1
1201	6/3/2024	B	1
1268	10/5/2024	A	1
1335	7/20/2024	B	2
1402	8/29/2024	A	1

Here is a sample of 6 rows from open_positions, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
position_ID	start_date	work_skill	region
1016	11/23/2024	B	1
1037	12/21/2024	A	1
1033	8/25/2024	A	1
1013	3/25/2025	A	1
1032	1/2/2025	A	2

Here is what I am trying to do:
I need to match/pair every row from employee_data to a row from open_positions.  Each employee_data row can only be paired once and each open_positions row can only be matched once. For each match, the available_date must be before the start_date.

Given above, loop through all potential sets of matches. For each loop, do the following:
	For each row pairing, calculate "points", which is defined this way:
		The days between the available_date and start_date count as one point. However, if the days between available_date and start_date are greater than 30, then add 500 points and do not calculate the difference in days.
		If the work_skill is different, then add 500 points.
		If the region is different, then add 250 points.
	Total the points from all the row pairings.
	For each row that is not able to be matched, add 1000 points to the total.
	If the loop is the first loop then save the total points score of the loop in a variable called lowest_total_points. 
	If it is not the first loop, check to see if this loop's total points is less than lowest_total_points value. If this loop's total points is less than lowest_total_points then save the employee_id/position_ID matches from this loop into a data frame. And assign the current lowest points value to lowest_total_points.
After all the cycles are over, the saved data frame should be the one with the lowest total points. Does this make sense? Is it something you can do?



# test query - not correct approach
Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets:

76	8/29/2024	499

Open position data set sample rows:
