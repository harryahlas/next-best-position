# Query 2

Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets, "employee_data" and "open_positions".

Here is a sample of 6 rows from employee_data, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
employee_id	available_date	work_skill	region
1067	8/29/2024	A	1
1134	7/2/2024	A	1
1201	6/3/2024	B	1
1268	10/5/2024	A	1
1335	7/20/2024	B	2
1402	8/29/2024	A	1

Here is a sample of 6 rows from open_positions, which actually has 100 rows in the full data set:
position_ID	start_date	work_skill	region
1016	11/23/2024	B	1
1037	12/21/2024	A	1
1033	8/25/2024	A	1
1013	3/25/2025	A	1
1032	1/2/2025	A	2

Here is what I am trying to do:
I need to pair one row from employee_data to a row from open_positions.  Each row can only be matched once. The available_date must be before the start_date.
For each row pairing, calculate a points score.
For each row pairing, please calculate total points, which is defined this way:
	The days between the available_date and start_date count as one point. However, if the days between available_date and start_date are greater than 30, then add 500 points.
	If the work_skill is different, then add 500 points.
	If the region is different, then add 250 points.
For each row that is not matched, add 1000 points to the total.





# test query - not correct approach
Please help me write an R script. I have 2 data sets:

employee_id	available_date	points
21	5/7/2024	0
1	8/29/2024	999
76	8/29/2024	499

Open position data set sample rows:
position_ID	start_date
1	8/4/2024
2	1/6/2025
3	3/17/2025
